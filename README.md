Issues and projects that seem promising for open source contributions

## Good places to search for ideas
* [Code Triage](https://www.codetriage.com/) - tracks tons of OS projects in multiple languages, good place to start a search
* [Ruby for Good - Yearbook](http://rubyforgood.org/yearbook.html) - lists of OS projects done to help charities and communities in need.  Have a slack chat that you can [join](http://rubyforgood.herokuapp.com )

## Projects
* [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues) - lots of issues labeled beginner friendly. Many skilled devs interested in helping someone get an open source commit.
* [Rollout](https://github.com/fetlife/rollout) - dev team uses this a lot, handy tool for developing 'dark' code that can be continuously deplyoed
* [Faker Gem](https://github.com/stympy/faker) - used by students and staff alike
* [Share Your Christmas](https://github.com/rubyforgood/share_christmas) - Matches kids in need with people that have extra (app supports Christmas, Thanksgiving & School Supplies). 

## Issues

* [Octokit support for GitHub Reactions API](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/issues/759) - Octokit is really well documented and comprehensive. Doesn't yet have support for new GitHub Reactions API.
